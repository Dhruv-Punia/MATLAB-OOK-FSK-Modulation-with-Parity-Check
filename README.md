# MATLAB OOK FSK Modulation with Parity Check
An end-to-end communication protocol designed in MATLAB consisting of eight functions for implementing On-Off Keying and Frequency Shift Keying modulation and demodulation. The protocol also includes parity error detection to enhance reliability and incorporates noise simulation to mimic real-life transmission conditions
